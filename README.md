# Popular Movies Project

## Project Overview
This project is the completed version of the **Popular Movies** app for Android Developer Nano-Degree through Udacity. It does the following:

* Requests a list of either Popular or Highest Rated movie posters from The Movie Database API
* Parses the data from the source JSON
* Displays a grid view of movie posters driven by the returned JSON data
* Responds to clicks on posters by navigating to a details screen
* Displays details for a selected movie, including poster, release date, vote average, title, and synopsis

## To Review
